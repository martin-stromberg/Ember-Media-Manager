# Database — Description

## Purpose

The local SQLite database holds the entire library state: movies, movie sets, TV shows, seasons, episodes and all related data (persons, genres, studios, countries, ratings, artwork, tags, external IDs, file and stream information, source directories). The tables follow the Kodi naming convention (`MyVideos`), keeping the library mappable to Kodi-compatible structures.

## How it works

- **File:** `MyVideos{Profile}.emm` in the profile directory; all access goes through the `Database` class (`System.Data.SQLite`).
- **Schema:** Initial schema in `MyVideosDBSQL.txt`; evolution via numbered patch files (`MyVideosDBSQL_v2` … `v47`) applied when the database is opened.
- **Transactions:** Batch operations (scan, multi-scrape) run transactionally (`CommandsTransaction`); single actions run directly (`CommandsNoTransaction`).
- **Flags:** Entries carry status such as New, Marked, Lock as well as source and file references.
- **Cleanup:** Cleanup functions remove orphaned entries (missing files, empty seasons, unused genres/studios/countries).

## Limitations

- The database is not intended for direct external write access; changes belong in the application.
- A schema upgrade is one-directional — backing up the `.emm` file before version changes is advisable.
- A corrupted database can only be recovered from a backup or rebuilt via a fresh scan.
